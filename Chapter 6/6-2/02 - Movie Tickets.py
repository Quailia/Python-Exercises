#A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

while True:
    age = int(input("How old are you?: "))
    if age < 3:
        print("Your ticket will be free of charge.")
        break
    elif age < 13:
        print("Your ticket costs $10.")
        break
    elif age > 13:
        print("Your ticket will cost $15.")
        break
